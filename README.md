* The truck load problem solved in this work involves maximizing the minimum load that can be delivered to a destination in case of a crane failure and simultaneously minimizing the maximum cost to deliver the load to a destination. 

* In this work, a non-linear mathematical model is developed and multi-objective optimization is performed using the epsilon-constraint method.
